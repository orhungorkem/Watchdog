/**
 * Watchdog is responsible for generating given number of processes and restarting them if any of them terminates.
 * On the other hand, watchdog passes process id's of its children to a named pipe where executor can reach. 
 * This helps executor in the sense of killing the signals to correct processes.
 * \n
 * To achieve these goals, watchdog opens the named pipe, generates the children by generate() and finally gets in an infinite loop.
 * In the loop, it waits for terminations of children by wait() system call.
 * When termination occurs handleTermination() is called where necessary actions are hold.

//! The function to handle termination of the child processes.
/*! 
 * Given pid and pidList, the terminated child is detected with a for loop.
 * Detecting which child is terminated is important since if P1 (head process) is terminated, all others must also be killed and restarted.
 * If another process is terminated, the job for watchdog to do is just restarting the terminated child.
 * In addition, the termination and restarting operation must be logged to watchdog output file, then inferring which child is terminated is important
 * in case of logging the process number of the corresponding child to watchdog output file.
 * \n
 * When head process dies, watchdog kills other processes by sending SIGTERM. To preserve the order of ascending process numbers,
 * wait system call is used after each SIGTERM sent. When wait returns with the news of child is terminated, the next child is sent SIGTERM.
 * \n
 * After each child process is killed, all of them are restared by generate().
 * \param pid The process id of terminated child.
 * \param pidList The list of process id's of child processes, to map the process numbers to process id's.
 * \see generate()
